# FCC-Python-data-analysis-certificate-proof

This repository acts as further proof, in addition to the certificate itself, that I've completed the freeCodeCamp Python data analysis course.
Since the certificate does not protect against plagiarism, I've included my worked-through and commented programs of the 5 challenges here, labelled c1 through c5 respectively.
I wrote my projects in VSCode (after copy-pasting the boilerplate and csvs) and copy-pasted them onto the repl, since I didn't really like working with their interface.
So now I've included the programs, the csvs and my generated plots for each challenge in the folders.

If you're working on this certification now, then good luck! :) feel free to browse through my solutions but please avoid copying unless you're really stuck and can't figure it out.
Since there are solutions everywhere and this course is free the real value is in working through the exercises yourself and gaining the experience and knowledge that will help you 
later in your job(s).
